## Current Phase
**Phase 6: INTELLIGENCE INJECTION READY**

## Last Major Action
- Core Architecture & UI finalized
- Data contracts locked (models.py, types.ts)
- Chaos Prime initialized with 3 directives

---

## Active Constraints

### ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES
1. **NO MOCK DATA** - All market data must come from real Binance API via CCXT
2. **REAL_DATA_ONLY** - `random()` and `faker` are FORBIDDEN for price/trade data
3. **CONSTRAINT PRIORITY** - User Constraints > Chart Signal > AI Interpretation

### 🔒 IMMUTABLE FILES (Manual Override Only)
- `prompts/chaos_prime.md` - READ ONLY, AI cannot modify
- `.context_memory/00_PROJECT_DNA.md` - Core identity file

---

## Critical Alerts

> [!CAUTION]
> Do NOT edit `prompts/chaos_prime.md` under any circumstances.
> If the user requests changes to it, ask them to edit manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before responding to any query, validate against this ACTIVE_STATE.
